# Mall Customers Clustering Analysis

## Project Overview
This project performs clustering analysis on a dataset of mall customers to uncover patterns in customer behavior. Using unsupervised machine learning techniques, the project groups customers based on their characteristics, which can help businesses better understand their clientele and improve customer segmentation.

## Features
- **Data Exploration**: Includes an examination of the dataset to identify trends and anomalies.
- **Visualization**: Employs Seaborn and Matplotlib to create insightful visualizations of the data.
- **Clustering Analysis**: Uses K-Means or other clustering techniques to segment customers into distinct groups.

## Dataset
The dataset, `Mall_Customers.csv`, contains the following columns:
- **CustomerID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Gender**: Gender of the customer.
- **Age**: Age of the customer.
- **Annual Income**: Annual income of the customer in USD.
- **Spending Score**: A score assigned to the customer based on their spending habits.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **dabl**: For data analysis and automation.

## Installation
To run this project, you'll need Python installed along with the following libraries:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn dabl
```

## How to Run
